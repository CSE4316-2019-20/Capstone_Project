- What you'd like to do on the project

## Description of the Problem
This [link](https://r5conferences.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/126/Robotics_Game_Manual.pdf) holds all of the details behind the IEEE Region 5 Robotics Competition.

### Electronics and Mechanics
The robot will need to move in some way. What design is optimal for the machine? Roomba? Four-wheel vehicle? What about processing power? What kind of computer can we use?
### Robotics
The robot will need to manipulate objects in a gentle manner. Objects vary in rigidity from aluminum cans to plastic bags. Also, we must raise objects from the ground to the opening of the trash cans.
### Computer Vision and Waste Classification
The robot will have to classify the waste. Will this classification affect the manipulation of the robot? Can we classify this waste with rudimentary sensors (ultrasonic, infrared, piezoelectric)?
### Signal Processing
The litterbug will produce gibberish and we will have to process what it is relaying. The competition hasn't yet specified this.

### Autonomous Operation
The robot will have to operate autonomously,
